Project 2 - SIC/XE Integer Reversal Program

Purpose: The purpose of this program is to take a string of 10 integers and reverse their order.

Input: There is no input for this program, the integers used are hardwired into the program itself.

Output: This program does not output anything.

Description: 
-This program takes 10 integers initialized in memory and reverses them.
-In the final memory dump at the end of sic.log file, the original list of integers is stored from location 0124 to 0142.
-The reversed list of numbers is located from 0142 to 0160.
